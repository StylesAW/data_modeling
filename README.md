# Overview

This is a Jupyter Notebook where I extract data from League of Legends API, transform it and dump that data into Snowflake and CSV files(optional). 
Try to open the jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/StylesAW/data_modeling/blob/main/data_modeling.ipynb)

**The second part of this project is the repository [data_pipeline](https://github.com/StylesAW/data_pipeline_lol) , where the process is automated using different technologies.**

## Setting Up the Environment

To get started, you can consider to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment in your project directory. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the necessary libraries to run the Python script.
